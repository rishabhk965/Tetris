  The original Tetris game was designed and programmed by Alexey Pajitnov in
  1984.

  The wiki at tetrisconcept.com has been a valuable resource.

  tt "Tetris for Terminals" was written by Mike Taylor in 1989.

  Hugo Fernbom and Andreas Carlsson have helped me with testing, ideas and
  feedback.
